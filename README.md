GridSound is a (work-in-progress) free HTML5 DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) based on the new [Web Audio technology](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API). A first release has been released and is still usable at [gridsound.github.io/v1-deprecated](https://gridsound.github.io/v1-deprecated/).

A new version is being developed and will be based on audio generation by oscillator, effects, etc. Currently only the UI of the new version is ready and has its own repo at [github.com/gridsound/gs-ui-components](https://github.com/gridsound/gs-ui-components). The audio code is still in development.
